# Overview
## Deployment Phase
This phase transitions from planning to **actual deployment** of the software.
## Responsibilities
  - Create or configure new infrastructure as required for the application.
  - Oversee the deployment process, including starting deployments and managing rollbacks if issues arise.
  - Handle pre-deployment backups and post-deployment restores to ensure data integrity.
  - Ensure that the deployment pipeline works correctly and that the application meets quality standards before going live
