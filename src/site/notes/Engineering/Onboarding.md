# Overview
Engineering roles come with an extensive training period on the stack for members before they are introduced and given access to the codebase. We regularly track progress for new members.

Refer to [Fall Recruitment Timeline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tIheQz-j-ikxgTW-kd9RsOML3uf8ej6QcbxRsjYuQc4/edit?usp=drive_link) for additional details.
# Onboarding Process

## Behavioral Interview
#todo 
## Technical Interview
Around 3-5 Leetcode questions. A mix of easy, medium and hard. This tests on data structures and algorithms, and problem solving skills. Throughout the interview we encourage applicants to explain their thought process as they approach these problems.

Writing code that's clearly documented, easy to understand and collaborative is much better than writing complex "smart" code other people have a tough time working with. Documentation is key.

We do not use recursion anywhere in the codebase. Always iterative.

## Skill Development
We provide access to a shared [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) account for the team and have courses outlined for each role. Please refer to [[Roles/Engineering/Engineering Roles\|Engineering Roles]] for more detail.
## Progress Tracking
We use [roadmaps](https://roadmap.sh) to track progress across our team members. Each role has different roadmaps and can be found for each role in [[Roles/Engineering/Engineering Roles\|Engineering Roles]]
