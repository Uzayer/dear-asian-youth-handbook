The handbook started as a way for the members of Dear Asian Youth (DAY) to make sharing information efficient and easy. We knew that future DAY members wouldn't be able to see emails, Discord messages, or 1:1 syncs about process changes that were happening before they joined and that eventually everyone who joined DAY later needed an easier way to onboard. The handbook was our way of ensuring that all of our company information was accessible to everyone regardless of when they became part of the team.

## Advantages

At DAY, our comprehensive handbook is integral to our organizational identity and communication. Its ongoing relevance is a collective responsibility of all team members. We have established these processes due to the following benefits: 
1. Reading is faster than listening, it allows asynchronous communication without interruptions or delays.
2. Individuals are more likely to retain information when they are informed about expectations before joining.
3. Collaboration improves when team members can access insights into the functions of other departments
4. Discussing changes is more straightforward when existing processes are readily available for reference.
5. Communicating changes is simplified by enabling individuals to easily identify and reference the differences.
